This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We are using 2 Reducers:

1. Updates a Rock Band List
2. Select Favorite Rock Band

A) Once you click at some Rock band name, your container it's gonna call (dispatch) your actiom, 
B) And then your Reducer (piece of state) it's gonna check whitch action was fired up
C) So your Root Reducer (that combine all reducers together into a single state) component it's gonna update your Root Componet
